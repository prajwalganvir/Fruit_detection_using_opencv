# A brief description of what this project does and who it's for

Fruit Detection using Python and OpenCV
Overview
This project aims to demonstrate fruit detection using Python and OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library). The application detects and outlines fruits in an image, showcasing the capabilities of computer vision in identifying objects.

# Requirements
Ensure that you have the following libraries installed before running the code:

Python (>=3.6)
OpenCV (cv2)
NumPy
# You can install the required libraries using the following command:

 bash
Copy code
pip install opencv-python numpy
Usage
 1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/fruit-detection.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd fruit-detection
Run the fruit_detection.py script:
bash
Copy code
python fruit_detection.py --image path/to/your/image.jpg
Replace path/to/your/image.jpg with the path to the image you want to process.

The script will display the original image with fruit detection bounding boxes.
Additional Options
You can customize the detection parameters by modifying the script or providing additional command-line arguments.
Sample Output
The output will be an image with bounding boxes drawn around the detected fruits.
